          We may use Personal Information that we collect about you for various
          purposes, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>To operate, provide and improve our Services</li>

          <li>To protect you, us and other users</li>
          <li>To give you a unique identity as a user</li>
          <li>
            Raah! avoids saving user information and wants to protect user's
            identity and preserve user's anonymity
          </li>
          <li>
            Although Raah! does not save or share anything, it's the

            they share with their buddy

          <li>
            The user's Number information, their partner's Number information
            and chats are only saved in case either party wants to report their
            partner. This is done to verify the incident and take action to ban
            the Number information if needed
          </li>
          <li>
            Raah! saves Number information of banned users permanently, as
